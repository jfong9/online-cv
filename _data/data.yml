experiences:
    - role: Software Engineer
      time: March 2016 - July 2019
      company: Westinghouse Electric Corporation
      details: |
        Worked in a small test team and internal tools team to write test procedures, code/create test cases, 
        and develop/implement new standard tool usage for other teams.
        - Created a full stack AutoCAD Drawing Tool. A Windows
          client/service application developed using C#, .NET, WCF, WPF, SQL, and the AutoCAD API
          to read a customer’s database and dynamically create AutoCAD drawings.
          - Replaced an aging platform with a modernized tool based on the .NET 
            framework which was made more user friendly, intuitive, and flexible 
            to cater to different customers’ needs.
          - Improved efficiency by reducing a highly used process that 
            took hours to run down to minutes.
          - Increased accessibility and collaboration capabilities through design choices.
          - Saved hours of overhead with content creation by designing the process 
            to be simpler, flexible and reusable.
        - Created Nuclear Application Program testing tools. A set of tools using VBA in MS Excel and Python. 
          VBA was used to generate Python interface declarations based on document specs. 
          The set of Python tools were used for defining nuclear application logic, 
          simulation, and result generation which was then independantly verified 
          and tested against the customer's plant process computer system.
          - Reduced costs through reducing human error, improving efficiency, 
            and increasing troubleshooting capabilities.
          -	Enabled non-programmers a way to write programmatic tests, allowing for more team involvement. 

    - role: Software Engineer
      time: June 2010 - July 2015
      company: C3-ilex
      details: |
        - Worked on a high-speed multi-threaded real-time data
          acquisition system (C++, MFC, VBA, FORTRAN, C#) to debug and
          resolve customer issues. Issues ranged from critical, hard to find, pre-existing 
          bugs (buffer overflow) to cosmetic user interface changes and functionality.
        - Developed new functionality according to customer needs, starting from
          requirements to completion.
